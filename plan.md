Plan

GAME LOGIC: About Rock / Paper / Scissors 

Two players compete to defeat the other by simultaneously drawing either Rock, Paper or Scissors. The winner is determined by the below:

Rock breaks Scissors
Paper covers Rock
Scissors Cuts Paper

Matching equals a draw - go again (score and number of turns remains the same)

Often the game is played as best of three games.

Normal it's drawn on three, but we might ignore this for now

Implementation Plan

- The game must be entirely within the console
- Use input on each turn
- We will need to ensure the option is either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, or else throw an error message
- We need to keep a score - Win / Loss / Draw
- We need to make sure that the order of who wins is included in our logic (if Statement)
- Stress test the game and try our best to break it with the console
- Declare a winner after two or three turns

Stretch Goal: Add a countdown on each turn


Resourcing Plan
Thursday Morning
- Develop the Plan
- Write the Flowchart

Thursday Afternoon
Pseudocode. possibly in subsections initially?
Attempt to get a working, basic version of the game
Optional - Look at our stretch 

Thursday Evening
TBC (Hopefully very little)
Individually look at implementing a stretch goal?


Friday Morning
Pair programming to compile the code
Debugging session
Prepare slides / presentation
Run through the presentation


Friday Afternoon
