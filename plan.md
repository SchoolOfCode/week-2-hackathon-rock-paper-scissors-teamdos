About Rock / Paper / Scissors 

Two players compete to defeat the other by simultaneously drawing either Rock, Paper or Scissors. The winner is determined by the below:

Rock breaks Scissors
Paper covers Rock
Scissors Cuts Paper

Matching equals a draw - go again (score and number of turns remains the same)

Often the game is played as best of three games.

Normal it's drawn on three, but we might ignore this for now
